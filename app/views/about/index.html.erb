    <h3 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h3>
    <p>Pearls of Hope was established in late 2009 by our Founder, sister Danyal Masoud. Danyal grew up in Chicago where , like many young Muslims, she faced many challenges and struggles. She started Pearls of Hope to provide a safe space for youth facing a lot of the same struggles she did growing up. She wanted to be the mentor she would have wanted and needed at their age. So Pearls of Hope was born in the basement of a masjid here in the Twin cities with one class of fifteen girls. The girls who joined the program were given the space to navigate feelings of insecurity and isolation that they often feel in our society. In sister Danyal, the girls found a loving mentor who would listen, counsel and support them unconditionally. They participated in circles of halaqa where they were given the tools to build a solid muslim identity in a an inspiring, engaging and fun environment. On March 30, 2015, Pearls of Hope Community Center was Incorporated. Through its impact, Pearls of Hope grew to offer guidance and support to over 200 youth across 7 programs. </p>
